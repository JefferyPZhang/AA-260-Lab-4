**Assignment:**
Consider a heat exchanger that uses hot air to heat cold water. Air enters this heat exchanger at
20 psia and 200◦F at a rate of 100 cfm and leaves at 17 psia and 100◦F. Water enters at 20 psia
and 50◦F at a rate of 0.5 lbm/s and exits at 17 psia. Determine the exit temperature of the water
and the flow powers required by the air and water through the heat exchanger respectively.
When you are all done, you can check with your TA for feedback before submitting the final
report.
Have fun!
